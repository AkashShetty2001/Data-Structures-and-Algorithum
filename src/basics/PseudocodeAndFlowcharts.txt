Pseudocode:
Pseudocode is a simple, plain-language description of an algorithm.
It uses structured steps similar to programming but without strict syntax rules.
It helps programmers plan the logic of a program before coding.
Itâ€™s easy to understand and convert to actual code.
Pseudocode focuses on the steps and logic rather than specific coding language syntax.

Flowcharts:
Flowcharts are visual diagrams that represent a process or algorithm.
They use symbols like ovals, rectangles, and diamonds to show steps and decision points.
Arrows connect these symbols to indicate the flow of the process.
Flowcharts help simplify complex processes and are easy to understand.
They provide a clear, step-by-step visualization of how a system or algorithm works.
